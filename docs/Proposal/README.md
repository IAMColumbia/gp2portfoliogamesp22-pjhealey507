For my project, I am going to be making a 2D platformer that utilizes the command pattern to implement clones that the player 
must use to reach the finish of each level. When the player restarts the level, a clone will be created that plays out the 
actions of the player's previous self (see pictures). The clones have full collision so that the player can interact with
previous versions of themselves.

Score scales inversely with clone amount to encourage efficiency (Less clones, higher score).
