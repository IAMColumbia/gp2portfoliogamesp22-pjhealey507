Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

The vertical slice adds level elements such as a goal point, 
buttons, moving platforms, and doors. There is also a 
mechanism for changing levels, restarting the level, and 
spawning clones on a timer.

How did you mange dependencies and state in your game?
Currently most of my objects don't have dependencies 

What Systems/Patterns are used?
The command pattern is used to keep track of the player's actions 
and give that information to the clones to replicate.

What still doesn't work, what could work better?
The level reset on clone spawn still needs more work, namely the 
level elements (doors, moving platforms) need to reset as well.

Does your structure limit your game?
I haven't run into a problem with my structure yet, so 
hopefully not.

How did certain patterns change your structure?
The command pattern makes the main mechanic possible, I also 
have been keeping the possibility of object pooling in mind
while making the structure.
