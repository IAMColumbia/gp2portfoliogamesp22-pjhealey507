Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

How did you mange dependencies and state in your game?
Currently most of my objects don't have dependencies 

What Systems/Patterns are used?
The command pattern is used to keep track of the player's actions 
and give that information to the clones to replicate.

What still doesn't work, what could work better?
The level reset on clone spawn still needs more work, namely the 
level elements (doors, moving platforms) need to reset as well.

Does your structure limit your game?
I haven't run into a problem with my structure yet, so 
hopefully not.

How did certain patterns change your structure?
The command pattern makes the main mechanic possible, I have 
also structured the game to allow for object pooling in the 
future.
